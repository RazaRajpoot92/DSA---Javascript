/* 
Time complexity

Is the measure of efficiency of algorithm in term of speed
(operations) as input sizes increases


Linear Search
has O (n)

Binary Search
has O (log n)

Some famous notations

O(1) => constant
O(n)
O(log n)
O(n**2)
O(n**3)
O(n!)


Space complexity
 is the measure of efficiency of algorithm in term of
 space its uses as input size increases

------

if space complexity is O(2n)
then we simply can ignore 2

O(n)

-----

Nested loops are consider as n**2
Independet loops are consider as 2n


Nested loop
for(o to n){
    for(0 to n)

}

Independent loops
for(0 to n){}
for(0 to n){}
